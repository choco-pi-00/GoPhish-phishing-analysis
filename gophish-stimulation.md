### 🛠️ 1. Setting Up GoPhish

1. Open your **Kali Linux** terminal

> App Passwords?
> 
> App Passwords are special 16-character access codes generated by Google when 2-Step Verification is enabled.
> 
> They let less secure apps or tools (like GoPhish) access your Gmail account without using your real password. 
> 
> It keeps your Gmail account secure while still allowing automation.
